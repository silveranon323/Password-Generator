# Password-Generator
With growing technology, everything has relied on data, and securing this data is the main concern. Passwords are meant to keep the data safe that we upload on the Internet. An easy password can be hacked easily and all personal information can be misused. In order to prevent such things and keep the data safe, it is necessary to keep our passwords very strong.  Here i created a simple application that can randomly generate strong passwords using the Python Tkinter module. This application can generate a random password, with the combination of letters, numerics, and special characters. One can mention the length of the password based on requirement and can also select the strength of the password.
